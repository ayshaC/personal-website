	<h2> Be Bold For Change</h2>
	<p>Wednesday April 26 2017</p>
	<br>
	<p>“Be bold for change”. This was the slogan of this year’s International Women’s Day, which is celebrated annually on March 8th. The meaning behind the idea? Encourage people around the world to be brave and take steps to create a more gender-inclusive working world. Having just finished my first term in engineering and then co-op in a large company, this felt especially relevant to me. Women are vastly underrepresented in STEM fields, (39% of graduates), and in leadership positions (30% of senior management positions). How depressing! Not just for women, but for everyone. We are missing out on some of the best ideas that drive innovation and economic progress. Luckily, over this term I had the chance to hear from some people who were being especially bold in forging a more gender-equal world. They brought up some great ideas…</p><br>

	<p><b>Lack of Women in Tech: Everyone Suffers</b></p>
	<p><a href="http://heatherpayne.ca/" target="_blank">Heather Payne </a>is the CEO of HackerYou and founder of Ladies Learning Code. She spoke at RBC’s Women in Technology and Operations event in February. One point she drove home was that when women don’t participate in the tech field, there are significant consequences. Everyone uses tech, but unfortunately, this technology is being created mostly by white men and therefore doesn’t properly serve its user group. An example: Google’s voice recognition software is much better at recognizing male than female voices. It’s food for thought – had there had been more women on the team, would the same thing have happened?</p><br>

	<p><b>There’s a Pipeline Problem</b></p>
	<p>So why don’t women end up in tech positions? Heather mentioned that it’s a problem that starts when girls are young. For some reason young girls aren’t being encouraged to pursue these fields. This means fewer women end up applying for tech jobs, and make up only 1/20 applicants to tech positions. One cause for this is bias in job posting descriptions. Luckily, there is software that exists to help us overcome this problem. At April’s TechTO event, the audience heard from Lily Tse, founder of <a href="https://www.thinkdirtyapp.com/" target="_blank">Think Dirty</a>. She brought up three tools that have helped her to create a more inclusive workplace, including <a href="https://textio.com/" target="_blank">Textio</a> and <a href="http://plum.io/" target="_blank">Plum</a>. Heather continued with mentioning that the pipeline problem continues into the actual workplace. Workplace policies may discourage women from staying at their job.</p><br>

	<p><b>Women Need Sponsors, not Mentors</b></p>
	<p>Another great speaker I heard from this term was <a href="http://www.pwc.com/ca/en/contacts/p/philip-g-grosch.html" target="_blank"> Phillip Grosch </a>, the leader of Digital Services at PwC Canada anc co-founder of PwC's Women in Leadership program. He spoke at RBC’s HeForShe event, and pointed out that the most important factor in creating a successful business is talent. Talent is not specific to any gender or social group, which is why having a diverse and inclusive workplace is so important. One obstacle that may prevent women from reaching their career goals is the lack of sponsors. A sponsor is a person who actively advocates for your professional success. They differ from mentors in that they help create career opportunities and advancements for you, rather than just providing guidance. Sponsors are critical to upward career movement. Unfortunately, since most senior positions are held by men, and men tend to sponsor men, women end up missing out on this crucial relationship. The solution? The <a href="http://gosponsorher.com/" target="_blank">#GoSponsorHer</a> campaign, which encourages men to sponsor women. Many high-profile Canadian leaders from companies like Microsoft, RBC, and McKinsey and Company have joined the #GoSponsorHer movement.</p><br>

	<p><b>What Can I Do?</b></p>
	<p>So, where is my place in all this? I am a young and inexperienced co-op student, and not really in a position to start a company or sponsor a high-potential woman that I know. Can I even help to make a difference? The answer is yes! After hearing about Ladies Learning Code, I looked into volunteer opportunities and attended some of their sessions as a mentor. I saw lots of enthusiasm from young girls about technology, and hopefully I was able to help to sustain that enthusiasm. I also went to the Toronto March for Science, which not only promoted the importance of science, research and the role it plays in our lives, but also making sure that science is an inclusive community.</p><br>

	<p>According to the World Economic Forum, I probably won’t live to see gender equality – they estimate that it will take 169 years. If we aren’t fully harnessing half of the world’s talent, then we won’t achieve our full potential economically or socially until then. This term I was exposed to many great ways for everyone, whether you are a first-year co-op student or a senior executive at large company, to help carve a place for women next to men in all fields. If everyone takes brave steps to make our society more equal, then maybe we can accelerate this potentially 100+ year process and enjoy the benefits of a gender-equal world.</p><br>
